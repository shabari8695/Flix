### Notes
Currently working towards playing the trailer modally. Though a new viewcontroller pops up when poster is clicked in detail view, the trailer either dosen't play or takes too long to load.

### Notes
With the first commit of the application I noticed that the last movie did not scale(coudn't see the last movie in the list properly) even for the iphone screen I used to design the application. The mentors were quick to reply and help me find a solution.
